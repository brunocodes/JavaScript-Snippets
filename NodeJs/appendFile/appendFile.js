/*
Q: is there any way in which the header row does not duplicate in the final merged file.
Good question, I don't recall off the top of my head. However, you can call a function to delete the top row from a file before appending, by calling:     
document.getElementById("myTable").deleteRow(0);          
Be glad to look more into it if this doesn't solve your problem!ï»¿
